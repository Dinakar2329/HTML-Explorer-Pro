# Contributing to HTML Explorer Pro

We love your input! We want to make contributing to HTML Explorer Pro as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed.
2. Update the version number following [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of one other developer.
